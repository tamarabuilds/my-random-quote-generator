Unit 01 project for the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree from Treehouse. I practied basic JavaScript syntax and data structures by building a Random Quote Generator, displaying a random quote when a user clicks a button or the page auto-refreshes.

## How It's Made

Tech used: HTML (provided by Treehouse), CSS (proided by Treehouse), JavaScript

Quotes are stored in an array of objects with the quote, source, citation, year and tag, wherever that information was available. Separate functions do the following actions:
 * getRandomQuote
 * printQuote
 * getRandomColor


## Extra Features

In addition to the base features, this project also includes:
 * An additional quote object property: tags.
 * Random background colors updated with each new quote.
 * Auto-refreshed quotes that change every 10 seconds.


## Lessons Learned

Picked up a bunch of skills including:
 * More familiarity with object manipulation.
 * Conditionals to check for object properties before dynamically rendering them.
 * Getting a random number with an arrow function call.
